 Add and delete screen for products
 
In the project, there is a popup that opens when you click the Add New button. New products can be added to the database via this popup. 
Products are viewed in two different types as list and grid. This is achieved with the button in the top right corner. 
The desired product can be deleted with the trash can sign under the products.

You can find some screenshots of the project below.
